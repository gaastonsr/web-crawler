# Web Crawler

Small crawler that parses html pages and return the top 5 most used words.

By default it crawls the first 30 pages that it finds, and shows the top 5 words that are at least 5 characters long but all this easily configurable by constants at the top of index.js.

I also included scripts to build it and deploy it to [webstask.io](https://webtask.io/).

## How to Build and Deploy

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
